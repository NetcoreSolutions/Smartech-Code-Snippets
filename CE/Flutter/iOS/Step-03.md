## Step 2: Adding SDK dependency - CocoaPods
In the Podfile add the `Smartech-iOS-SDK` as a dependency.
```ruby
pod 'Smartech-iOS-SDK', '~> 3.7.3'
```
Run the following command to update the added pod in your `Podfile`.

```
pod install
```
Once your installation is complete, you will have to open the `workspace file (YOUR-PROJECT-NAME.xcworkspace)` that is created.
